# GridsearchCV-hyperparameter-tuning
This project demonstrates hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` for three machine learning models: Random Forest, SVM, and KNN. Each model is tuned with the F1 score as the evaluation metric to find the optimal hyperparameters. The project includes detailed notebooks for each model and offers insights into model performance.
